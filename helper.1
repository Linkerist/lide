.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBhelper\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays a helper taken from the database in

that is specific for the current date.
.SH INTEGRATION
If you invoke
.B helper
from /etc/profile then the daily devotional helper will appear on each
login for each user. Alternatively you could put the invocation of
.B helper
into the .profile of a user and have each user choose if he wants to use
helper or not.

Note that you will run into trouble if you have dialin users whose scripts
call pppd and put the helper call into /etc/profile. The output might confuse
the ppp programs.
